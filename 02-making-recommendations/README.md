# Recommendations Algorithm

## Content-Based

If Person A likes an Item A, Person A might like items similar to Item A.


## Collaborative Filtering

If Person A likes item 1, 2 and 3 and Person B likes 2, 3 and 4, and Person A is similar to Person B, then Person A should like item 4 and Person B should like item 1.

Can be further separated into three parts:

- User-User collaborative filtering
- Item-Item collaborative filtering
- Market basket analysis
