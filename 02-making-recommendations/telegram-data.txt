Announcement - RailsCasts
Short Ruby on Rails screencasts containing tips, tricks and tutorials. Great for both novice and experienced web developers.
 Too bad the reason he's doing it because he's feeling burned out
 But still. Great news. Tons of great contents

 Any local shop selling Tessel 2?
 https://tessel.io .. The closest is China, but wondering if there is any local shop selling it as well

[3:15:50 PM] Faiz Mokhtar:
I remember that I bought the subscription for Railscasts 2 month before he burned out.
 Are most of the videos in there still relevant? Pretty sure a lot of the gems discussed already gone through some changes.

[3:35:55 PM] Tokwan:
Most of the time I watch them to see how he did it, or some basic idea how the gem works. For me, watch 10 minutes of his video works better than me reading for 10 minutes

[3:57:17 PM] Amree:
I like the text version, faster to skim through. But when I have time, I just watch the whole thing
 His price is pretty low (compared to others), gorails and rubytapas cost nearly $20

> Shouldn't have given the access to junior isn't it? Another ques
They don't give access to junior. They basically gave access to everyone because the credentials used as a sample code in the documentation turn out to be a real credentials. Before the junior incident, everyone seem to intuitively replaced the "fake" credentials in the example with their own credentials, so things working as expected. But the junior made a "mistake" to execute the command as is, without replacing the "example" credentials.
 This is one of the reason we don't have access to production db at all from dev machine.

Do you guys practice on-call shift to watch over production system ? Previously, I don't agree on having on-call shift, preferring "mutual responsibility" approach. But now I started to feel it's bad for everyone, as that mean everyone can't "disconnect" from work at all time. We currently discussing how the on-call shift should look like - 2 days per shift, or one week shift etc. We only a team of 5 currently.

I prefer 2 days shift, but some prefer weekly shift.

Dash is a Python framework for building analytical web applications. No JavaScript required.
 It is something like Shiny from R

[9:59:53 AM] Ahmad Syazwan:
Tangential: I got my elder brother, a doctor in HKL to dabble in R. I even setup his shiny server. He's by no means technical and it was a challenge to get him to grasp simple concepts (teaching remotely) but honestly I didn't do all that much. Made me realize that efforts put into making these tools friendly paid off. A doctor with no tech background albeit with a techie lil bro managed to make a few medical analysis R apps.

Funnily enough, I started him first with Python and Jupyter notebook. I thought the easiest path into coding analytics. Unfortunately it didn't click with him. So ultimately options and alternatives are good.
 Got him to buy his own domain yesterday instead of piggybacking mine. saifulsafuan.com if you're interested. His most useful one is probably the dengue app.

> Efficiency. How long is that going to take you to write
for the same purpose, i write faster in php/python compared to bash

[5:24:43 PM] Ang ChinHan:
And assuming bash is on your server is also probably a bad idea. busybox is way too prevalent now. Can't remember the number of times I see newbies totally screwing up because of wrong bash usage/permission/piping.
 And the concept of $CWD screwing people up, and the lack of tty (interactive) stuff screwing up cronjobs. "Why my script runs on command line, but not on cron?"

[5:26:20 PM] Jun Yi:
For one-off scripting, bash is faster to write than python

[5:26:43 PM] Chee Leong Chow:
awww, no love for power shell?

[5:26:55 PM] Ang ChinHan:
Just a bigger footgun.

[5:27:33 PM] Jun Yi:

I'm looking into this as I'm thinking of having more specific Ops role in our team. Need to define what Ops role really is.

[6:15:00 PM] Ang ChinHan:
Not the person that does development. But everything else, make sure everything is working. Preemptively.

[6:30:25 PM] Chee Leong Chow:
the person that streamline deployment process and makes sure everything works.

[6:43:13 PM] Ravin Optional:
My take:

1. Will love the developer to be able to do testing, development, and prototyping without thinking about servers and infrastructure.
2. Talk to developer and understand how they write code, experiment and test it. Improve the process of deploying applications
3. Not just creates VMs but also do release management.
4. Dreams in the night that developers never have to speak to operations.
 Holy grail.
5. Doesn't hate developers and think they are just monkeys who only know how to deploy fragile code.
6. Do the work that normally ops are intended to do(Make sure infra works.)

The resize makes the image smaller, you would think intuitively that more data would help a computer vision problem

Can anyone educate me on the certification program like lpic ? I want our devs to have more fine grasp of the operational side and thinking maybe a more formal course is better way to instill the mindset. All this while I have been trying doing it on my own but not seeing the result that I want. It still end up me who have to do the bulk of the operational work - thinking of the network structure, security issue, capacity planning etc when deploying new services.

Does the exam has specific date or we can always get on it throughout the year ?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx5WQjXLlq8

Few notes:-

Vertical partitioning of objects like users, comments, likes using django multible db support.
Logical shards using postgresql schemas - hard to implement in django. End up implementing their own ORM. Only used for Likes.
Sharded unique id - timestamp + shard id + sequence
Justin Bieber (early adopter of IG) started posing problem to them - in early days dev have to remember justin user id and make sure it's shard get it's own physical server.

@asyazwan maybe I still reserve on having git as specific transport mechanisme to move the app artifact around. And the push vs pull model. But what I like about heroku are more on the higher level concept:-

1. heroku create xxxx - provisioning deployment environment.
2. Procfile - as high level definition what's running.
3. heroku config:set - for config management
4. heroku scale - scaling up/down resource

My experience is to take the cert you dont have to take a official course. To obtain the cert  you just need to pass a computer based exam(multiple choice question + cloze question). What i had was going trough a fast track, the trainer incidentally was a cto guy and ops expert, he literaly knew linux inside out. He gave option, folks who want to just pass the exam can just focus on doing the example exam question and folks who want to have actual hands on experience can go through hands on lab. Most folks just wanted to pass the exam, and didnt give a shit about hands on.

You can take the LPIC anytime, and I don't think the cert helps that much, just a confirmation that you know Linux. it doesn't cover the *why* of doing certain things, and IMHO, some parts feels too cargo cult (you do it because every one says to do it).

Just to add on top of what angc said. The cert just say you passed the exam. Becoz there are exam banks online that provide dummy exam you can take, if you are lucky enough the exam bank will have prettt much similar questions to your actual exam. My class mates basically did similar thing. So be wary of judging an employee based on the cert alone.

Since I'm paying, I am the customer. Me as a developer is using it. When I saw the intro the first time they introduced it, I was pretty excited. My code can finally run without a server? How did they do it? Turns out it's not serverless, I still need a server. I just pay and use it during certain period of time instead of keeping it alive all the time. From my point of view as a developer, I still need a server. Serverless is not the right name for this kind of service. That's all. Haha

Depends, but avoid if possible. ACID with triggers is expensive. You might want to defer them in an external queue. Or at least have the option to. If you started relying on db triggers, moving away from that may be expensive work.
 At least there's deferrable in pgsql.

[10:27:15 AM] Kamal:
Up until now, we never think about trigger. Most can be done using basic sql. For example when deducting customer's credits, we log the operation so we always have an audit trail of what get deducted at certain point in time. But now we have an external process, not much we can control that also updating our db. We need a way to have an audit trail of this operation and trigger seem to be the easiest way (other than forking the app and having burden maintaining it going forward).

DO is direct console too iirc. But ec2 web console is just an ssh client, no different that ssh command on your laptop.
 of course all exposed through the web. The different is that direct console mean the web app connected through the instance tty interface directly, while ec2 web console is implemented as ssh client, connected to the ssh port.

Hi guys,  in corporate settings,  where everybody is using Outlook, are there ways to have better conversation thread in emails?
 If an emails thread actually have smaller "threads" in them,  it's quite hard to reply on them.
[7:50:13 AM] Izzat Zainol:
If you are referring to an archived threads. Usually I would attach the email (.msg file). Instead of replying all. This is good when dealing with forwarding stuff, BKM's and compiled todo's.

[7:53:33 AM] Ikhwan Hayat:
I meant when your in email discussion,  like when the OP has multiple issues waiting for replies in one email.  Then you'll go "Kindly read my replies below" then u put your replies in between quoting the original msg. Then the next person do the same.
 It would get pretty unmanageable after a while.
 I know,  better to use Slack for this. But man these people love their Outlooks.

Ok. From what the speaker say about Cloud Spanner. Cloud Spanner is the firsr Global Relational Database. Meaning that you wont have regional constraint as other sql in google service(and other cloud service). Example of regional constraint; to access the database, some gcp service require the database to be local region (if service in tokyo, db must be in tokyo), but your database park in other region.
 However, Cloud Spanner works differently, If I remember correctly from what he say, the query is different

 From reddit:-

A friend of mine was annoyed that a small service he liked was shutting down. He contacted the developer who said that they were shutting it down because the server costs were higher than the money they were making.They were spending 5k a month on AWS crap and claimed it was impossible to get any lower. He helped them consolidate everything onto a single rented dedicated server costing 400 a month. Now the service is profitable, and will stay up. It runs way faster on the single server. It also has required less maintenance after the move too. This kind of shit is everywhere. At this point simply not using AWS is a competitive advantage.
 after almost 10 years, I'd almost forgot how it feel using the bare metal :joy:

if co founder usually higher
 if early employee / important role in early stage .. 5% - 10% is already good
 usually salary a bit less than standard rate and compensate by stock
 if salary get standard rate and 5-10% stock consider lucky already
 (based on my experience with my last startup as cto .. but my vested is 5 years .. i left the startup after 1 year .. soo .. that is just a lottery ticket :P )

 but it all depends on you

because % changes with every dilution

[12:23:07 PM] Hassan odin88 Java/.Net/PHP Developer:
correct
 percent is 1 think
 amount of stock / share also 1 thing

[12:23:32 PM] TC Wu:
and either due to not enough time or maliciousness, the bigger shareholders might neglect to inform you that your % changed and then you kena rude shock, unless you can have a provision to your contract built in where you can dllution protection ( which is highly unlikely ), it is always preferable to have # units of shares

[12:24:10 PM] Hassan odin88 Java/.Net/PHP Developer:
the more and more investor then ur percentage become smaller .. but the value should be higher ..
 and also got 2 types of stock right ?
 i forgot already

[12:24:35 PM] TC Wu:
The idea is that you should care about: vesting, change of control, termination, tax treatment, etc. I've never seen the total shares outstanding on a plan, grant, or offer letter. You'll see the total available pool on a plan, but that usually comprises 17-20% of outstanding.

Discord *runs* on ErlangVM. It's writting in Elixir, if I read it correctly. If anyone is wondering, Elixir/Phoenix can use multiserver channles (via phoenix) https://dockyard.com/blog/2016/01/28/running-elixir-and-phoenix-projects-on-a-cluster-of-nodes

Not sure if discord uses that though.

My personal preferences would be Lenovo. Too attached with the chicklet keyboard and the red nipple. Can't never go wrong with thinkpad model except the price. freakin expensive 🤣 but company money, just use it lah
 1st model i used, T410. sturdy and heavy at the same time. next is x230. small but cant live with the small screen :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:. right now comfortably used yoga thinkpad. just nice :+1:🏼
 but if you looking for budget model you can look lenovo ideapad as @mkamalmustafa  suggested. but 7XX series a bit high end. take a look at 3XX series

Kfit is like a marketplace for fitness class etc i think. Ni more like a tool. Like slack/whatsapp for fitness coaches
 At the moment coaches do online coaching using whatsapp. Handling 5-10 people is still ok. But when it grows to 30-50 a lot of features needed
 Still in development tho. Expected end of this year launch

[1:28:13 PM] Kamal:
if you have dedicated team to maintain service A, and another team for service B, then go for microservice. But if you just a few devs already full at hand, then fwiw, go monolith.
 moving over to microservice is still possible at certain point, but to go back into monolith once you regret, almost impossible.

[3:04:14 PM] Kamal:

> Minimization of work. Unix tools philosophy. Horizontal scaling.
it will end up in lot more work. You must have automation in place first before jumping into microservice. If your microservice can't (isn't) be decribed in docker-compose.yml (or anything similar) yet, forget about jumping to microservice.
 otherwise you'll be spending whole day trying to setup new dev environment to fix small bug that might be creeping in between of all the services.
 I made a mistake of allowing this microservice hype creeping into our architecture 2 years ago, and now suffering the consequences. That's why you can see I'm raging out whenever people talk about microservice :grin:

Just sharing as a very satisfied user. Ripgrep is an excellent replacement to grep. It's blazing fast! https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep

GitHub
BurntSushi/ripgrep
ripgrep combines the usability of The Silver Searcher with the raw speed of grep.
 Why shouldn't I use ripgrep?

I'd like to try to convince you why you shouldn't use ripgrep. This should give you a glimpse at some important downsides or missing features of ripgrep.

- ripgrep uses a regex engine based on finite automata, so if you want fancy regex features such as backreferences or look around, ripgrep won't give them to you. ripgrep does support lots of things though, including, but not limited to: lazy quantification (e.g., a+?), repetitions (e.g., a{2,5}), begin/end assertions (e.g., ^\w+$), word boundaries (e.g., \bfoo\b), and support for Unicode categories (e.g., \p{Sc} to match currency symbols or \p{Lu} to match any uppercase letter). (Fancier regexes will never be supported.)
- ripgrep doesn't yet support searching compressed files. (Likely to be supported in the future.)
- ripgrep doesn't have multiline search. (Unlikely to ever be supported.)

In other words, if you like fancy regexes, searching compressed files or multiline search, then ripgrep may not quite meet your needs (yet).

hey quick one
 i am building a chat bot server
 golang vs nodejs
 i built my prototype in both
 still a bit undecided
 my brain knows that golang will be able to process text files faster
 because compiled language etc
 and i will be processing an obscene amount of text files
edited 
[3:39:50 PM] Jun Yi:
Zero to Bot, which one is easier/faster (to code)?

[3:40:19 PM] TC Wu:
but i also think nodejs will be faster to build, because more libs

i know both langs equally well, as in ok-lar at both

[3:40:43 PM] Ang ChinHan:
Traditionally, I'd suggest you use elixir for the "best" tool at chat servers. But ahem. Microservices required if you wanna mix/match with other parts of your app.

[3:41:12 PM] Jun Yi:
Specifically to the prototypes you built of course, since you already built it

[3:41:36 PM] TC Wu:
@angch have you been talking to dexter codo recently? he's usually the guy who goes on and on about elixir

[3:41:54 PM] Ang ChinHan:
Don't remember him.

[3:42:10 PM] TC Wu:
well, not gonna have time to learn new lang for this
 well i probably can do it
 but
 i don't want to introduce another language to our dev stack mix

which is already rails, kotlin for android, swift for ios, python, and golang

[3:43:04 PM] Jun Yi:
What kind of text procesing are you doing?

[3:43:07 PM] Ang ChinHan:
What chat platform? That'll hint you towards which libs is more mature.

[3:43:18 PM] TC Wu:
all the non english ones
 the lines and wechats of the world

Every other damn Go lib I'm whinging about is from China. So there.

[3:43:54 PM] TC Wu:
so golang it is
 @vandeput for official accounts

[3:44:09 PM] Jun Yi:
Ease of maintainability comes first imho, then the rest depends on if the amount of text is huge enough to go beyond IO bottleneck into CPU, then maybe its worth investing in compiled lang.

[3:44:20 PM] TC Wu:
line haven't checked out yet @vandeput i assume so, because they're big in some ASEAN countries
 the amount of text is relatively small per instance @realityredefined but there will be a lot of it
 if you know wechat

[3:45:07 PM] Chee Leong Chow:
golang is not fast at parsing text though

[3:45:12 PM] TC Wu:
they let official accounts respond in some kind of markup, i intend to create a simple tool to let our marketers and designers use to create the markup

Well then, lang doesnt really matter. Just pick the one that you like to maintain

Poeple laughed at me when I shared this in another group sometimes ago. They said they have been in china and what in the article far from truth and wechat not even dominating china.

This Chinese messaging app is taking the country by storm — and Facebook should pay attention
In China, WeChat is more than just a messaging platform.

can you use wechat/alipay in that restaurant?

[3:54:56 PM] Ang ChinHan:
Still a pain to enable non-china people to use wechat pay to pay for things there. Need china bank account.

next logical question should be when were they in caina, because wechat became a hit starting only a few years ago

[3:55:22 PM] Ang ChinHan:
> Irvan Putra
> can you use wechat/alipay in that restaurant?
Yes. They keep asking if we can use those to pay instead.

[3:55:31 PM] Irvan Putra:
Wow.

[3:55:36 PM] Ang ChinHan:
Had to resort to get local friend to pay with wechat first and then pay them later.

True

i was told u can go to their pasar and buy fresh vege with wechat wallet

also apparently they recently crippled whatsapp, hence making wechat one of the largest chatting platform if not the only one

Don't use the chinese documented only API libs. You'd wanna er... delegate it to others to clean up later.

I believe node.js should be the fastest to develop, and easy to deploy. you can deploy node.js app in aws lambda, and quickly iterate your bot

But you can't get Dave to write and maintain the Go code. ;) (Unless he can read Chinese)

@Sharuzzaman i cannot deploy this chat server outside of china unfortunately, i discovered this the other day while testing, the wechat admin testing suite cannot reach heroku or AWS

AWS got china region
 but maybe no lambda yet

aliyun free tier is more free than AWS free tier lol

thats my main reason with going with aliyun, same with BAE
 actually quite interested in checking out BAE
 its also an opportunity for me to brush up my chinese

[4:08:35 PM] Sharuzzaman Ahmat Raslan:
yup. lambda not in beijing

[4:08:51 PM] TC Wu:
i want to see how advanced is BAE compared to heroku
 which is the PAAS that i am most experienced with

what is BAE?

:) Not too hard to have libs for Go.... only big questions is you use cgo for sqlite, etc. Then need to decide on glibc, musl, alpine, etc.

[4:10:38 PM] TC Wu:
baidu app engine @Sharuzzaman

Doing Elasticsearch now, but still experimenting to find the right algo and scoring weight. So I'm thinking to make the booster to be customizable through an admin panel instead of having to commit each time, pass code review, pass CI, merge then deploy
 Right now I'm thinking to just store the custom boosters in Redis. Any other way?
